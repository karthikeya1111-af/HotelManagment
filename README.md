# HotelManagment
This project is a console-based Hotel Reservation System developed in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It allows users to search, book, cancel, and manage hotel room reservations, with room categorization and simulated payment functionality. Data is persisted using File I/O, simulating a basic database.
